<div class="legacy-center">PRESS BRIEFING <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BY<br />  PRESS SECRETARY ROBERT GIBBS<br />  &nbsp;</div>
<div class="legacy-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room<br />  &nbsp;</div>
<div class="legacy-para">2:33 P.M. EDT</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; How is everyone?&nbsp; My only announcement is I endeavor to make this briefing</div>
<div class="legacy-para">shorter than this weekend&rsquo;s Gridiron dinner.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But other than that -- Ms. Loven.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Can you talk a little bit about the bank rescue program &ndash;- go ahead.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I'm just trying to get the podium -- go ahead, sorry.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Talk a little bit about the bank rescue program.&nbsp; I know that the --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">(Interruption as podium rises.)&nbsp; (Laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, bank rescue -- serious, somber.&nbsp; Leverage, lifting out the money, you&rsquo;re still</div>
<div class="legacy-para">only going to get out, as I understand it, between $500 billion and a trillion of these bad</div>
<div class="legacy-para">assets, which is about either a quarter or a half -- depending on what it gets to -&ndash; of what</div>
<div class="legacy-para">people think is the amount on the books.&nbsp; What is the &ndash;- how is that effective?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; But I think &ndash;- let&rsquo;s understand before we surmise what that number could be, to</div>
<div class="legacy-para">understand that one of the things the health assessments on the banks will do is give a</div>
<div class="legacy-para">greater understanding of exactly what that is.&nbsp; I do think what Secretary Geithner laid out</div>
<div class="legacy-para">today, though, will &ndash;- using both public and private money in order to clear from the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">balance sheets of these banks toxic or legacy assets is a plan that will get the economy</div>
<div class="legacy-para">moving and get credit flowing.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's my question &ndash; how do you know it&rsquo;s going to get the economy moving?&nbsp; If you're</div>
<div class="legacy-para">only getting at what some say -- as I said again -- either a quarter or half of --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, again -- I guess I don&rsquo;t want to buy into the premise that --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- the bad assets and you don&rsquo;t even know &ndash; if you you're saying you don't even know</div>
<div class="legacy-para">how much is on their books, then why even go ahead with the plan now?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Because you guys keep asking for it.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, again, look, I think it&rsquo;s</div>
<div class="legacy-para">safe to say that these troubled assets are there and Secretary Geithner and the President</div>
<div class="legacy-para">are taking strong action through this plan to get them off the balance sheets and to get</div>
<div class="legacy-para">credit moving again.&nbsp; I think that obviously this is a plan that balances public and private</div>
<div class="legacy-para">risk.&nbsp; It allows the market to set the rate so that the government doesn't overpay for assets.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">And we're confident that, as the President said, that this will take steps in the right</div>
<div class="legacy-para">direction in order to remove these from balance sheets and get credit flowing again -- loans</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that will go to small businesses and families, big businesses alike -- I think is a strong steps in</div>
<div class="legacy-para">the right direction.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">In terms of the size and the amount, obviously this is a bid use $75 to $100 billion worth</div>
<div class="legacy-para">of TARP money to leverage a much larger pool of capital to do this, and I think it's -- it's</div>
<div class="legacy-para">a strong step in the right direction.&nbsp; I would point out, as -- this is one of many steps</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that the economic team and the Obama administration have taken since coming to office.&nbsp; This</div>
<div class="legacy-para">is yet another facet to this -- the challenges that the economy has faced just through</div>
<div class="legacy-para">financial stability, leaving aside the President's strong desire to have an Economic</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Recovery and Reinvestment Plan that will create jobs and get the economy moving again.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">But this is another step in terms of unfreezing credit markets, dealing with home prices and</div>
<div class="legacy-para">home foreclosures.&nbsp; Obviously the remaining step, through the health assessments, is to</div>
<div class="legacy-para">determine what capital banks might need under a worst case scenario.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">So I think, again, it's a positive step in the right direction and one of many steps that</div>
<div class="legacy-para">we're taking under -- under this administration to get the economy moving again.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has said this toxic debt plan is almost</div>
<div class="legacy-para">certain to fail.&nbsp; He's called it a rehash, a recycling of a cash-for-trash plan that was</div>
<div class="legacy-para">abandoned -- that was proposed and then abandoned by the Bush administration in the fall.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Any response to that?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, I mean, look, I -- without responding I guess directly to that, I think</div>
<div class="legacy-para">what -- look, the alternative to a plan that manages risk and reward and doesn't have the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">taxpayers shouldering 100 percent of the burden is to do exactly that and shoulder the whole</div>
<div class="legacy-para">thing.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">I also think that if you look at -- as I said a minute ago, I think this is a system that</div>
<div class="legacy-para">also takes into account having market help in determining the price of -- the price of some</div>
<div class="legacy-para">of these troubled assets to ensure that the government doesn't overpay.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">And, look, I think some of Mr. Krugman's argument is also -- in some ways deals with a</div>
<div class="legacy-para">different aspect of the plan, and that's bank capitalization.&nbsp; I think -- I don't think</div>
<div class="legacy-para">anybody that reads anything about these plans should misunderstand that there is another</div>
<div class="legacy-para">step in terms of the health assessments, as I said, of these banks in order to determine,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">through public or private means, whether additional capital is needed in order to survive</div>
<div class="legacy-para">under the worst case scenario of an even more severe recession than we're experiencing right</div>
<div class="legacy-para">now.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">But the President and the team are confident that the plan as outlined will take crucial</div>
<div class="legacy-para">steps in freeing up credit and getting the economy moving again.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But how do you reassure private investors who might invest in this plan that they might</div>
<div class="legacy-para">not -- that they wouldn't be subject to the same kind of push-back on, say, executive</div>
<div class="legacy-para">bonuses that AIG is facing, since in fact the investors in this plan would be receiving</div>
<div class="legacy-para">discounted taxpayer -- discounted investments?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, look, I mean, I think this obviously is a -- this is a different program</div>
<div class="legacy-para">than what was set up under or what exists under TARP.&nbsp; Obviously there's a line that has to</div>
<div class="legacy-para">be walked in understanding that the public and the taxpayers shouldn't and don't want to</div>
<div class="legacy-para">shoulder a hundred percent of the risk.&nbsp; But I think the balance that's struck here in</div>
<div class="legacy-para">sharing that risk and spreading the reward is one that is able to navigate that.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Chip.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of navigating, introducing this plan puts you in between Wall Street</div>
<div class="legacy-para">executives who are skeptical because of the precise point that was just made, that there</div>
<div class="legacy-para">might be some sort of populist backlash, and legislation trying to clawback something from</div>
<div class="legacy-para">earnings that they make from this, and populist rage on Capitol Hill.&nbsp; What have you done --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">or the administration, what has the administration done to reach out to both sides to make</div>
<div class="legacy-para">sure that this works?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, obviously, this is a result of extensive discussions with both Capitol</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Hill and people both on Wall Street and involved in the market in order to set up a plan</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that we think will best achieve the objective of freeing up capital.&nbsp; Look, I think whether</div>
<div class="legacy-para">-- I mean, I think the President spoke clearly about this over the weekend in the interview</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that he did with &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; in understanding that we -- taxpayers are very much correct</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that we have to understand and deal with excessive compensation and bonuses.&nbsp; And the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">President has outlined a plan to start on that, so that bonuses aren't a way of rewarding</div>
<div class="legacy-para">people that are not succeeding; bonuses have typically been something that's given to people</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that are doing well.&nbsp; But also we have to take steps to ensure that whatever is done, is</div>
<div class="legacy-para">done in a way that furthers our recovery and stabilizes our financial system.&nbsp; And look,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">it's something that the President is aware of.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">In all honestly, Jake, I don't -- I think this is -- this has not been a -- this is not a</div>
<div class="legacy-para">new tension.&nbsp; I think this tension has been certainly prevalent if not completely, if it had</div>
<div class="legacy-para">lacked -- even if it lacked obviousness, in all honesty, for a long, long time, even dating</div>
<div class="legacy-para">back to the -- before the middle of September of last year when bailouts became a word that</div>
<div class="legacy-para">more Americans were hearing --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it's peaking a bit, I mean, in terms of Wall Street skepticism and also populism on</div>
<div class="legacy-para">the Hill.&nbsp; I'm just wondering if you could be a little bit more specific about what specific</div>
<div class="legacy-para">outreach you've done.&nbsp; Did the President, once the plan was in place, did he call bicameral,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">bipartisan leadership in the Hill and brief them?&nbsp; Did Geithner go to Wall Street and talk</div>
<div class="legacy-para">to people there and talk to CEOs?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, I know -- I know that Secretary Geithner is in New York tonight, obviously</div>
<div class="legacy-para">speaking, and I'm sure that will involve an audience that includes both CEOs and bankers.&nbsp; I</div>
<div class="legacy-para">can certainly check.&nbsp; I don't have in front of me what the -- whether or not the President</div>
<div class="legacy-para">talked to -- explicitly to Capitol Hill about this.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">But look, I think that is -- that's something the President understands, that tension.&nbsp; And</div>
<div class="legacy-para">I think the steps that he has taken and will take underscore the notion that we have to deal</div>
<div class="legacy-para">with what are sometimes forces that are pulling in opposite directions.&nbsp; I think it</div>
<div class="legacy-para">underscores the necessity of working to try to get it right, and not lurching in any one</div>
<div class="legacy-para">direction but navigating opposite forces in order to do what's right for the economy.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert, in rolling out the details today, Timothy Geithner used a more, sort of, quiet</div>
<div class="legacy-para">approach -- pen-and-pad with reporters, not getting out there on television in a very public</div>
<div class="legacy-para">way.&nbsp; Why?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; You guys always -- every time we do one of these things, we do a background</div>
<div class="legacy-para">briefing, and somebody asks if it can be on the record --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this was a major --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp;&nbsp; -- and, you know, we don't want just a speech, we'd like to do some Q&amp;A, and so</div>
<div class="legacy-para">we put the Secretary of Treasury out on the record to --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a major event.&nbsp; Everyone was waiting for the details, and it almost seemed</div>
<div class="legacy-para">like it came out in a less than, sort of, bombastic way.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I guess he's worried a little bit less about what the packaging is on the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">present, and more importantly, what&rsquo;s inside of the box.&nbsp; I suppose we could have rigged out</div>
<div class="legacy-para">some flags and printed up some placards and cued up some old campaign music, but I think</div>
<div class="legacy-para">what&rsquo;s important -- maybe not for Washington reporters, but what&rsquo;s more important for the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">American people is to get the details of a plan that works to get their bank lending money</div>
<div class="legacy-para">again.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">I think that's, in all honesty, what the Americans people care most about.&nbsp; I think if you</div>
<div class="legacy-para">objectively look at what this administration has done, or what the economic team has done in</div>
<div class="legacy-para">the course of about nine weeks of service, I think you&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find nine weeks</div>
<div class="legacy-para">where more solutions were outlined of problems and challenges that have been facing this</div>
<div class="legacy-para">country probably since the 1930s.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to follow another question &ndash;- Christina Romer, in&nbsp; an interview with CNN earlier</div>
<div class="legacy-para">today, talked about how if this doesn&rsquo;t work that we&rsquo;ll review it &ndash; we&rsquo;ll tweak it, I think</div>
<div class="legacy-para">was the exact language that she used.&nbsp; Is there a backup plan if this doesn&rsquo;t work?&nbsp; And to</div>
<div class="legacy-para">say &quot;tweak&quot; it, does that sort of instill sort of a lack of confidence that this will</div>
<div class="legacy-para">actually work?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Do we have a backup plan if it doesn&rsquo;t work, and if we do have a backup plan,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">does that denote that we're preparing for it not to work?&nbsp; I want to sift through the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">circular --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked a backup plan because she said if it doesn&rsquo;t work we'll &quot;tweak&quot; it.&nbsp; But I'm</div>
<div class="legacy-para">just wondering, does that give a sense of --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Again, I think it is safe to assume that any policy that this administration or</div>
<div class="legacy-para">-- I'll speak broadly for any politician in the country -- if they roll out a plan, it&rsquo;s</div>
<div class="legacy-para">constantly evaluated to ensure that the objectives by which the plan was introduced are met</div>
<div class="legacy-para">by the implementation of the plan.&nbsp; And if the plan doesn&rsquo;t meet through its implementation</div>
<div class="legacy-para">the objectives of what it was outlined to do, that that plan might be augmented to meet</div>
<div class="legacy-para">those objectives.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was deep.&nbsp; That was deep.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; That was more this than that.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On pricing, what makes you confident that they will be able to find prices here that</div>
<div class="legacy-para">private investors are attracted to, and what happens if they don't?&nbsp; Does this thing just</div>
<div class="legacy-para">fail?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; No, I think -- and obviously -- and I think Secretary Geithner talked about this</div>
<div class="legacy-para">this morning -- but, look, you have competing interests and putting these two competing</div>
<div class="legacy-para">interests together gives each involved an incentive to find a way to do business that</div>
<div class="legacy-para">ultimately works for the American people.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Obviously we've talked a lot about the need -- in this room -- for banks to have bad assets</div>
<div class="legacy-para">off of their balance sheets.&nbsp; So that gives somebody the incentive to figure out how to do</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that in a way that makes sense for them and still provides them that belief.&nbsp; Obviously</div>
<div class="legacy-para">having a public-private partnership also gives both taxpayers and private investors that</div>
<div class="legacy-para">have the wherewithal to deal with a lot of this stuff -- gives them the incentive to look</div>
<div class="legacy-para">for something that makes sense for them and for the taxpayer.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">So I think you&rsquo;ve created basically a supply-and-demand type auction that allows people to</div>
<div class="legacy-para">get what they need.&nbsp; That market, through that supply-and-demand model, can set a price that</div>
<div class="legacy-para">allows each objective to be met.&nbsp; And I think obviously -- I think there&rsquo;s a tremendous</div>
<div class="legacy-para">incentive for banks to want to take advantage of an opportunity that allows them to get past</div>
<div class="legacy-para">some of these bad assets.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will it simply be a free market out there for pricing these assets, or is the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">government going to be in there at some point almost as an arbitrator trying to push the two</div>
<div class="legacy-para">sides together?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, I think it&rsquo;s probably a little early to talk about that.&nbsp; I know there are</div>
<div class="legacy-para">people that are interested in the program, as was denoted in the morning papers.&nbsp; And I</div>
<div class="legacy-para">think that whenever you have willing buyers and willing sellers, the market can help</div>
<div class="legacy-para">instructively set a price that works for both entities and, in this case, something that</div>
<div class="legacy-para">will protect the taxpayers.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t find the pressure of the government alone shouldering</div>
<div class="legacy-para">all of the risk and the burden, willing ultimately to pay much more than an asset might be</div>
<div class="legacy-para">worth.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Chuck.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert, can you give us sort of a little bit of a scorecard for the public?&nbsp; So when</div>
<div class="legacy-para">are the first purchases?&nbsp; When should we expect to start seeing the first purchases?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I think Secretary Geithner did not necessarily give a date, but said that --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">obviously and this is -- they've had discussions obviously with the Fed and FDIC about</div>
<div class="legacy-para">setting up this structure.&nbsp; Obviously the FDIC has some experience in this, as well as the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">ability for each in terms of their role in the financing.&nbsp; So I think this is something that</div>
<div class="legacy-para">people will see quite soon.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who's going to run the public investment corporation?&nbsp; Is there going to be one person</div>
<div class="legacy-para">who is going to be like, sort of, a CEO or a manager?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I would point to -- Treasury might have a more specific answer, if there's one</div>
<div class="legacy-para">person that does it.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And finally, are you comfortable that there is a -- that this is democratized?&nbsp; So, for</div>
<div class="legacy-para">instance, that it -- it does seem like this is geared toward getting people with a lot of</div>
<div class="legacy-para">money, but there isn't a component for Joe in Kansas City, you know, or Jane in Des Moines.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Do you know a Joe in Kansas City?&nbsp; Like, every example is some Joe in Kansas</div>
<div class="legacy-para">City.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's wrong with Kansas City?&nbsp; (Laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plumber --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert, we're on a --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Look at me, you don't think I like Kansas City?&nbsp; (Laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a (inaudible) meat shop.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Right.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the poor Royals franchise.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; There you go.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in all seriousness, that they -- that there does seem to be a -- where there wasn't</div>
<div class="legacy-para">an ask of the American public to sort of get involved in this or -- do you feel like there's</div>
<div class="legacy-para">enough of a way for average citizens to participate in this?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, look, I think -- yes, I think, obviously through investments and obviously</div>
<div class="legacy-para">-- look, the taxpayers will share in the reward for assets that do.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, right now it's hedge fund guys and pensions plans -- sort of like this --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- you know, the same Wall Street that everybody has been beating up on.&nbsp; Is there --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, but, I mean --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you feel like you --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Do I think -- you know, we've talked a lot about pension funds and what's</div>
<div class="legacy-para">happened to them over the course of the last few months.&nbsp; I think obviously them being</div>
<div class="legacy-para">involved does give Joe in Kansas City the ability, through an investment in his pension</div>
<div class="legacy-para">fund, to do well.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Jonathon.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You got a couple of big things happening on Capitol Hill this week.&nbsp; First, if the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Senate moves forward with its -- toward its bonus legislation -- there was a sense at the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">end of last week that what happened to Chris Dodd nobody wants happening to them.&nbsp; And they</div>
<div class="legacy-para">felt like, you know, if they did anything that would look like watering down a bonus bill,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">they would be excoriated and that the White House or the administration would not bail them</div>
<div class="legacy-para">out; that there was a sense that Dodd kind of twisted in the wind until Thursday, when</div>
<div class="legacy-para">finally Tim Geithner said, yes, it was us that asked for that change.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">I'm wondering, first, are you guys sensing that -- that you have dance partners on Capitol</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Hill to deal with some of the issues you've raised about these bonus legislations?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I'm don't --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you feel -- are there Senators there who are willing to talk to you about your</div>
<div class="legacy-para">concerns that some of this legislation may be going too far?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, again, I think what the White House would communicate to Capitol Hill, to</div>
<div class="legacy-para">any member, to both sides, is exactly, again, what the President talked about -- how he</div>
<div class="legacy-para">would ultimately evaluate any legislation, which I had repeated earlier, which is to</div>
<div class="legacy-para">understand that we cannot and should not reward failure with bonuses, and the message that</div>
<div class="legacy-para">would send, but also to make sure that we don't do harm to the financial system.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And are you finding a receptive audience?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I don't know if they just heard what I said, but I hope it was received well.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Second, the budget bills are going to be rolled out this week, as well.&nbsp; And I</div>
<div class="legacy-para">wonder if now you can talk about how appropriate you feel it would be to do a national</div>
<div class="legacy-para">health plan with reconciliation language so that it couldn't filibustered.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, look, I think the debate on reconciliation is months and months and months</div>
<div class="legacy-para">ahead of itself.&nbsp; I think if anybody is concerned about how this is going to be resolved,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">the best way is the exact way the President answered a question, I think, to a Republican</div>
<div class="legacy-para">member of Congress at the first event we had here where the President took questions.&nbsp; And</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that is, the best way to resolve the rising cost of health care is to have entities from all</div>
<div class="legacy-para">sides come together to find a solution.&nbsp; That's what -- that's the priority of this</div>
<div class="legacy-para">administration and certainly of this President.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">I think the notion that something that might happen in August and September, when it's still</div>
<div class="legacy-para">chilly outside and we're only in late March, I think gives a lot of short shrift to the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">notion that people in this town ought to be able to work together to find solutions to some</div>
<div class="legacy-para">of our biggest problems.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But on that, what some Republicans -- Judd Gregg, for instance -- are saying that if</div>
<div class="legacy-para">you have reconciliation language in these budgets on health care, then the liberals who will</div>
<div class="legacy-para">be pushing one agenda on health care will know that they have the upper hand, because if you</div>
<div class="legacy-para">fail to get some bipartisan deal, then always fall back and --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Let me -- two points on that.&nbsp; One is, I think that gives, again, short shrift</div>
<div class="legacy-para">to the notion that people should have good ideas about a problem we've talked about for</div>
<div class="legacy-para">several decades; there isn't a lack of good ideas out there.&nbsp; And the second thing I might</div>
<div class="legacy-para">mention is it is interesting to see the views on reconciliation and how they've changed</div>
<div class="legacy-para">since, say, the Bush tax cuts in 2001.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Mark.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert, can you say definitively now that the President won't sign the House-passed</div>
<div class="legacy-para">bonus tax bill?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Again, I would repeat exactly what he said last night, which is --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, he declined to embrace it, certainly.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, he -- I guess the -- well, let me tell you what I heard, and we can argue</div>
<div class="legacy-para">about that.&nbsp; Again, the President, I believe, said that the bill would be evaluated again on</div>
<div class="legacy-para">the two pillars with which I talked about.&nbsp; And, you know, I think to get ahead of where</div>
<div class="legacy-para">anybody else is in understanding that the process will go through the Senate, and we will</div>
<div class="legacy-para">certainly evaluate whatever were to come down Pennsylvania Avenue.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on a related issue, do you feel or does the President feel that the American people</div>
<div class="legacy-para">are beginning to suffer from bailout fatigue, with all of the bailouts going on, and today</div>
<div class="legacy-para">you announced yet another new bailout program for the toxic assets?&nbsp; How do you go about</div>
<div class="legacy-para">dealing with that?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, look, I think the American people very much lament, as does the President</div>
<div class="legacy-para">and everyone in his administration, that we find ourselves at the point today that we do,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">because of any number of factors that have led up to this point that find ourselves facing a</div>
<div class="legacy-para">declining jobs market, a home foreclosure crisis, a financial stability crisis, a lack of</div>
<div class="legacy-para">appropriate regulation in the market that matches where we are and the advanced technical</div>
<div class="legacy-para">nature of our financial system.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">But I think the American people as -- again, as the President said last night, I think he</div>
<div class="legacy-para">wants the American people to understand that the steps that he's outlining and that we're</div>
<div class="legacy-para">taking today will help free up money in the system so that they can borrow money again, so</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that their small business that has a spotless credit rating isn't hounded to get money every</div>
<div class="legacy-para">two weeks from a bank because -- not of their doing but of something in the larger financial</div>
<div class="legacy-para">system; or that if -- again, if they've got a good credit history but can't find a willing</div>
<div class="legacy-para">bank to borrow money to send their child to college, that the steps that are being taken,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">and I explained a little bit of this, obviously there is -- there can be a tension between</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Wall Street and Main Street, but I think the President was clear that we're all in this boat</div>
<div class="legacy-para">together and that the only way that we're going to get this economy moving again is to do a</div>
<div class="legacy-para">series of things:&nbsp; invest in the recovery; reregulate our financial industry; deal with home</div>
<div class="legacy-para">foreclosures; but also stabilize our financial system -- that all of these have to be done</div>
<div class="legacy-para">together.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Look, the truth is, Mark, that today's announcement alone is not going to fix our economy,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">just as any individual piece of this taken in only itself isn't going to alone fix the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">economy.&nbsp; But all these things together can help what ails the system, free up credit,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">create jobs, put money back in people's pockets, and get the economy moving again.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At enormous expense.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; At an enormous expense that the President believes should be done in a more</div>
<div class="legacy-para">transparent way so that the benefits can be recouped by the taxpayers and that our economy</div>
<div class="legacy-para">can get growing again.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert, back to the bonus legislation, does the President or the White House have some</div>
<div class="legacy-para">suggested language for the Senate to consider?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Not that I'm aware of, no.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you leaving hands off, letting them work their will upon it?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I can certainly check and see if there's any updates to a legislative strategy.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you going to jump into it at the House-Senate conference committee?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, you're ahead of the process by at least a good step.&nbsp; So --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't hear you saying that you're going to guide the Senate or offer them some</div>
<div class="legacy-para">language, so I assume --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, again, I'd check on the update of where we are and tell you the way the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">President would evaluate legislation that might come out of something like a conference</div>
<div class="legacy-para">committee.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one other thing.&nbsp; Is there any financial regulatory package coming this week?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I believe Secretary Geithner will testify Thursday -- I'm not sure if it's on</div>
<div class="legacy-para">the House or the Senate side -- and begin to outline principles for regulatory reform that</div>
<div class="legacy-para">we hope will pass by the end of the year.&nbsp; And obviously you know that this will be a big</div>
<div class="legacy-para">topic in a week or so, when we go to London.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's going to roll it out at the hearing?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Yes, sir.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Yes, ma'am.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does the President think of the formation of this group of moderates?&nbsp; Is it</div>
<div class="legacy-para">designed to sabotage his agenda by Democrats?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Look -- no, I think for a long time we've had groups of like-minded</div>
<div class="legacy-para">legislators that have banded together to make -- and embrace policy prescriptions that they</div>
<div class="legacy-para">think are the best way to solve the challenges that we face.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">I think he looks forward to working with anybody in the Senate not constrained by their</div>
<div class="legacy-para">membership in one area or constrained by any label.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, isn't it premature to try to undermine these programs?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I don't think the assembling of a group of moderate either Democrats or</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Republicans the President certainly wouldn&rsquo;t see as undermining his agenda.&nbsp; I think in many</div>
<div class="legacy-para">ways seeking solutions to these challenges is something the President would hope everyone</div>
<div class="legacy-para">does and it wouldn&rsquo;t provide any impediment to what he&rsquo;s trying to do.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Major.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert, one on the FDIC and one on executive compensation.&nbsp; Obviously Treasury and the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Fed are part of this, the private investors are, but the largest component of this credit</div>
<div class="legacy-para">system to absorb the toxic assets is the FDIC.&nbsp; And most Americans who think about that as</div>
<div class="legacy-para">thinking about the guarantor of their own savings accounts.&nbsp; What can you say to those</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Americans who might hear this and understand that the FDIC is going to be the biggest player</div>
<div class="legacy-para">in this to ensure that their confidence in their own savings remains valid and what steps</div>
<div class="legacy-para">the administration is going to take to make sure the FDIC can not only do this task, but its</div>
<div class="legacy-para">central task, which is protecting depositors?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, I think you can -- I think the American people can reasonably be assured</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that we wouldn&rsquo;t be taking steps forward with the chair of the FDIC if both the President</div>
<div class="legacy-para">and the FDIC weren&rsquo;t very assured that this was the right step to take and that the function</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that they have performed for a long, long time would in any way be undermined.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">And I think Secretary Geithner was asked this question at his briefing this morning, as</div>
<div class="legacy-para">well, and I think the notion that -- he reassured those that the FDIC can do, as you</div>
<div class="legacy-para">mentioned, the primary function that most Americans would associate with it, as well as</div>
<div class="legacy-para">their ability to take on an additional role and shoulder a burden for the taxpayers.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On executive compensation, there were some reports this weekend that the administration</div>
<div class="legacy-para">is open to limits on executive compensation for publicly traded companies that have nothing</div>
<div class="legacy-para">to do with TARP, that aren&rsquo;t asking for any government financing for anything.&nbsp; Is that</div>
<div class="legacy-para">true, number one?&nbsp; And number two, if you are a buyer into this program, if you are helping</div>
<div class="legacy-para">the government soak up some of these toxic assets, should you assume that if you enter that</div>
<div class="legacy-para">pool you might, yourself, as a company or a equity fund or investment house, be limited or</div>
<div class="legacy-para">subject to future executive compensation limits?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, again, as I mentioned earlier, I think the program that was outlined today</div>
<div class="legacy-para">is separate from what has previously been outlined in the TARP program.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, no?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Right.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so are publicly traded firms.&nbsp; Is the administration open to that all?&nbsp; Does it</div>
<div class="legacy-para">think it needs to change the culture there?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I mean, I think the President has talked broadly about this, but I think details</div>
<div class="legacy-para">of a proposal on that are ahead of itself.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the administration at least is open to that?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, again, the President previously supported providing shareholders with a</div>
<div class="legacy-para">non-binding vote, a say on their pay, that through public opinion, the White House believes</div>
<div class="legacy-para">would sway executive compensation.&nbsp; But --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that's a bottom-up, not a government --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I don't have any details far beyond that.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- about the government doing this?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Right.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Mike.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, the head of the European Central Bank said that Europe doesn&rsquo;t need to</div>
<div class="legacy-para">increase spending more to combat the financial crisis.&nbsp; How concerned is the administration</div>
<div class="legacy-para">about what appears to be kind of a growing opposition in Europe to further stimulus</div>
<div class="legacy-para">spending, which seems to be a direct contradiction to what the President wants?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, I actually think that there -- well, I think the President has talked to,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">and will talk to even more leaders that will be involved in the G20 throughout this week --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">obviously Prime Minister Rudd will be here tomorrow and he&rsquo;s got some calls scheduled for</div>
<div class="legacy-para">later in the week.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">But I think that certainly coming out of the finance ministers&rsquo; meeting a few weeks ago,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">there was actually broad agreement that -- and the administration, as I&rsquo;ve said from here,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">has never -- there was never any intention to have everybody sign a document that required a</div>
<div class="legacy-para">certain level or percentage of spending relating to their GDP, as was mentioned -- as the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">IMF suggested.&nbsp; But I believe that what was agreed on at that meeting was to continue to</div>
<div class="legacy-para">monitor what might be needed to stimulate economies in order to address the downturn in</div>
<div class="legacy-para">production that each economy will see as part of a global recession.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">And I think the President will address this more tomorrow and throughout the week -- that I</div>
<div class="legacy-para">think there is a lot of commonality in the agenda that the administration will pursue and</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that other nations in the G20 will discuss next week at the summit, including, again,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">monitoring the spending situation to ensure that if the recession becomes deeper or more</div>
<div class="legacy-para">severe, that steps might be taken; that financial regulation is something that is enormously</div>
<div class="legacy-para">important in a changing world; and lastly, that -- I know there is strong agreement that as</div>
<div class="legacy-para">their markets have shrunk quickly because of this global recession, that exports have been</div>
<div class="legacy-para">pulled back greatly, particularly those in more developing nations, that funding and help go</div>
<div class="legacy-para">to those developing nations through the IMF in order to spur job creation and exports here</div>
<div class="legacy-para">in this country.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">You know, the President I think will probably use the same term on this -- I think you'll</div>
<div class="legacy-para">hear him say this later this week -- that he looks at the London economic summit as an</div>
<div class="legacy-para">agenda that is both/and rather than either/or.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Sheryl.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert, a spokesman for Mikhail Gorbachev says that the President met Mr. Gorbachev</div>
<div class="legacy-para">here at the White House on Friday.&nbsp; What can you tell us about what they talked about?&nbsp; And</div>
<div class="legacy-para">why didn't the White House disclose the meeting?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I believe it was in the guidance that the Vice President was meeting with Mr.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Gorbachev.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's not the President.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, the President tends to roam around the larger house, and sometimes walks</div>
<div class="legacy-para">into meetings that weren't previously on his schedule.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could roam -- he could roam here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I think we did that once, and it seemed like Bourbon Street on Fat Tuesday.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="legacy-para">(Laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what did they talk about?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What group did he -- (laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; The President -- well, look, obviously Vice President Biden met with the former</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Soviet President Gorbachev, and obviously they discussed continued ways in which the United</div>
<div class="legacy-para">States and Russia can work together to reduce our nuclear arsenal.&nbsp; I think that's going to</div>
<div class="legacy-para">be part of the upcoming topic when President Obama and President Medvedev meet in London;</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that we continue to talk about ways in which we can further the agenda on mutual interests</div>
<div class="legacy-para">like nuclear proliferation; on energy; on a whole host of ideas.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did he try to solicit Mr. Gorbachev's thoughts on missile defense and perhaps how to</div>
<div class="legacy-para">secure cooperation with the Russians on that?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I can certainly check on that.&nbsp; I don't know if that was discussed in the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">meeting.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to the assets program, briefly.&nbsp; Eventually, and especially if the program takes</div>
<div class="legacy-para">off, you're going to have to go back to Congress for more money.&nbsp; Do you think they're</div>
<div class="legacy-para">likely to stump up substantial amounts of money to help private investors make money off of</div>
<div class="legacy-para">--</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I think the American people and I think Congress and I think the President and</div>
<div class="legacy-para">the administration are focused not on what has to happen months from now or longer than</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that, but how best to implement a program that will get the economy moving again.&nbsp; I think</div>
<div class="legacy-para">it's wildly premature to get -- to get a whole lot farther down the road on that.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Yes.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to follow up on the question about Gorbachev.&nbsp; Vice President Biden, prior to</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that, met with a different Russian delegation, with some business people.&nbsp; Is he the point</div>
<div class="legacy-para">man now at the White House on relations with Russian?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; No, I don't think he's the point person.&nbsp; I think obviously the Vice President</div>
<div class="legacy-para">plays an extraordinarily important role in this administration's foreign policy.&nbsp; He has</div>
<div class="legacy-para">great experience through many years serving on the Foreign Relations Committee, and I think</div>
<div class="legacy-para">is a valued member that the President leans on repeatedly.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you remember a meeting on Russian policy where the President directly participated?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Where he didn't participate?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where he directly participated -- the President.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, I just told you he was at Sheryl's secret meeting just a minute ago.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm glad you called it &quot;secret,&quot; Robert.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, I -- Sheryl's secret meeting.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't say it was secret.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was talking more about strategy -- strategy-setting meetings here at the White House,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">not with guests.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Oh, oh.&nbsp; I can look back at his schedule, but I think it's safe to assume that</div>
<div class="legacy-para">we've discussed, as has been written, developments on policy that either is bilateral policy</div>
<div class="legacy-para">with Russia or policy that includes Russia as one of many that take part in important</div>
<div class="legacy-para">issues.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one last thing.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; No, no, I have to get to Ann -- I'm all Russia'd out.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert, what happened to the word &quot;toxic&quot;?&nbsp; Do you have some marketing czar now who</div>
<div class="legacy-para">decided that &quot;legacy loans&quot; is more attractive to private investors than the word &quot;toxic&quot;?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I think I used &quot;toxic&quot; earlier, so if the -- if there's a marketing czar, I've</div>
<div class="legacy-para">failed to get his or her memo.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert, what does the President --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Maybe I didn't read my own memo.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Sorry, go ahead.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the President hoping to communicate tomorrow night with the press conference?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, I think as he's done over the past -- certainly the better part of the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">past week, whether it's on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; or on &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; is to address directly</div>
<div class="legacy-para">with the American people that challenges that the country faces and the choices that he's</div>
<div class="legacy-para">working on with Congress to put our economy back on track and put the nation back on firmer</div>
<div class="legacy-para">footing.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">I think the -- I think the President has -- believes that a continued dialogue with the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">American people about where we are and where we're going is necessary certainly in times</div>
<div class="legacy-para">like this to give people a sense of what we're doing and a sense of where we're going; that</div>
<div class="legacy-para">they may or may not like all the decisions that he makes, but I think he believes it's</div>
<div class="legacy-para">important that they understand why he's making the decisions that he is.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there will be an opening statement?&nbsp; Lengthy?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Not lengthy -- well, I guess it depends on your definition of lengthy.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; You know, two, three hours.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gridiron-lengthy?&nbsp; (Laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I want to note that Chuck said that about the Gridiron, not me.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">April.&nbsp; Ms. Ryan.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; For your lengthy question.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Just playing.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I know.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; On the continued dialogue issue, will there be any news</div>
<div class="legacy-para">tomorrow night --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I think that largely depends on the many important and impressive reporters</div>
<div class="legacy-para">assembled in the room in which they will ask the President cutting questions and elicit</div>
<div class="legacy-para">news.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, you know what I'm talking about.&nbsp; I'm talking about an opening statement.&nbsp; Stop</div>
<div class="legacy-para">being flip.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; If I can't be flip, April, this is going to be pretty darn boring, isn't it?&nbsp; I</div>
<div class="legacy-para">guess we'll just have to go back to the lower podium.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">I have not -- I have not read the full opening statement yet, but I will make sure that if</div>
<div class="legacy-para">there is news, that the news reporters are apprised of such.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, all right.&nbsp; Also --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In defense of Gridiron, I want to say the Vice President was half-hour late.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Oh, well, I'm going to get somebody down here to give a 30-second response to</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that, Helen.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Yes.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert, one more question on the economy.&nbsp; As the President is trying to save this</div>
<div class="legacy-para">economy, the global economy is suffering as well, and this country has in the past borrowed</div>
<div class="legacy-para">money from other countries, particularly China.&nbsp; What happens if some of these countries</div>
<div class="legacy-para">call their debts due from the United States?&nbsp; You know, many of have said it would</div>
<div class="legacy-para">destabilize this country.&nbsp; What happens?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, two points on that.&nbsp; One, this certainly came up a few weeks ago when --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">relating to the Chinese.&nbsp; And I think said then and I would said again that this country</div>
<div class="legacy-para">remains the strongest and deepest capital market on the planet and the safest investment</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that anybody could make.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Secondly, I would say that the President recognizes that we have to change our path of --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">our fiscal path and put ourselves back on one that's far more sustainable than what we've</div>
<div class="legacy-para">seen recently.&nbsp; That's why the budget that he sent to Capitol Hill makes investments that</div>
<div class="legacy-para">will grow our economy, but most importantly will cut the deficit in half in his first term;</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that the President recognizes that we can't continue to do what's been done with simply</div>
<div class="legacy-para">passing debt on to different generations.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a country does call some of the money due, are we -- no, it's a serious question.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I didn't say it wasn't a serious question; it's a seriously hypothetical</div>
<div class="legacy-para">question and one I'm not --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it's a reality -- it could be a reality in this tough global economic recession.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; April, I -- the minute it becomes a reality, I assume your hand will be straight</div>
<div class="legacy-para">up in the air and I will call on you then.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Yes.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert, the EPA has forwarded its endangerment finding to the White House.&nbsp; Can you</div>
<div class="legacy-para">enlighten us on whether there's an actual plan?&nbsp; Are they recommending a scheme for</div>
<div class="legacy-para">regulation?&nbsp; And could you also talk about the timing of it, how quickly --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Yes, I think something popped up right before I came out here and I haven't</div>
<div class="legacy-para">delved into this.&nbsp; I know that -- I think the President has made quite clear on this that he</div>
<div class="legacy-para">is -- the way to deal with greenhouse gases is to work with Congress in order to put</div>
<div class="legacy-para">together a plan that deals with this and creates a market for renewable energy.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">As you know, the Supreme Court, through their ruling, requires the EPA to look at the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">potential public health risk that CO2 might cause, and I think that is -- not having seen</div>
<div class="legacy-para">it, I think this is the -- just a step in that process.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Steve.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert, the President sent out his political operation into the field over the weekend,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">going door to door all over the country to muster support for the budget.&nbsp; What's your --</div>
<div class="legacy-para">what's your -- what have you heard?&nbsp; How did it go?&nbsp; What kind of reaction did they get?&nbsp;</div>
<div class="legacy-para">And is it producing anything?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Well, the only number I heard this morning was that about a million doors were</div>
<div class="legacy-para">knocked on over the course of the weekend in order to build support for the President's plan</div>
<div class="legacy-para">to make the important investments in health care, energy independence, and education reform,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">and put ourselves back on that path toward fiscal sustainability, all of which is contained</div>
<div class="legacy-para">in the budget.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">And I think the President believes that whenever the public can get more greatly involved in</div>
<div class="legacy-para">the process, as Congress starts through committees this week and on the floor next week,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">approving a budget for next year, that that involvement, and hearing the opinions of people</div>
<div class="legacy-para">that are reached through that door-knocking, are important in the process.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it producing emails, phone calls?&nbsp; And do you have a goal on how many people you</div>
<div class="legacy-para">want to call in or send their messages to Congress?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; I can check and see on that.&nbsp; I would say if we knocked on a million doors, then</div>
<div class="legacy-para">our goal was probably 750,000.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the President see a rebuff or any signs of hope in Iran's response to his message?&nbsp;</div>
<div class="legacy-para">And have you guys made any assessment as to how deeply this has penetrated into Iranian</div>
<div class="legacy-para">society, how much the (inaudible) has been passed, et cetera?</div>
<div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:&nbsp; Let me check on -- if there were any Internet metrics that are important.&nbsp; Look,</div>
<div class="legacy-para">the President, as you heard him talk about in the message, this was an effort and an</div>
<div class="legacy-para">opportunity to speak directly to the Iranian people and their leaders, to underscore the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">potential for a new and changed relationship based on our shared rights and</div>
<div class="legacy-para">responsibilities.&nbsp; The President believes it's time for that change.&nbsp; And regardless of any</div>
<div class="legacy-para">response or -- the President is hopeful that the Iranian leadership will work to change the</div>
<div class="legacy-para">way that they do business.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Thanks, guys.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.</div>
<div class="legacy-para">END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />  3:21 P.M. EDT</div>
