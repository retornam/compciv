Hi, everybody.
About a year ago, I promised that 2014 would be a breakthrough year for America.
And this week, we got more evidence to back that up.
In December, our businesses created 240,000 new jobs.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.6%.
That means that 2014 was the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s.
In 2014, unemployment fell faster than it has in three decades.
Over a 58-month streak, our businesses have created 11.2 million new jobs.
After a decade of decline, American manufacturing is in its best stretch of job growth since the '90s.
America is now the worldâ€™s number one producer of oil and gas, helping to save drivers about a buck-ten a gallon at the pump over this time last year.
Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, about 10 million Americans have gained health insurance in the past year alone.
We have cut our deficits by about two-thirds.
And after 13 long years, our war in Afghanistan has come to a responsible end, and more of our brave troops have come home.
